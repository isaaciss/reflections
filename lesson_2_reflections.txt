What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 The folder .git is created. Because it is necessary having the files under a version control system.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 It just has the files which the user wants to commit at once. It is great because you can add and commit specific files instead of everything that is inside your working directory.

                                                                                                                                                                                          
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Using commands such as git diff and git diff --staged

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
when you want to create something new and you aren't sure if it will work, so you need to keep a master version working. It helps to give a name to a try o new implementation.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They make easier the way to work with many branches (gitg is a software for linux that does it very well).

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
New features get together to the master branch. Two line (branches) become one.

What are the pros and cons of Git’s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
