What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

	when you have the control, you make a version whenever you want or need but some times you may forget to version a considerable amount of changes.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because it is easyer using like that. When you have to save each one by one is not such a good thing to do.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can find the history, see comments (messages) and verify the diference between 2 commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Git asure you to go back to some version that it is ok, so you get more confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
