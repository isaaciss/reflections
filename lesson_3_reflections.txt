When would  you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Almost immediately. It's good to have a versioned copy from my files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because sometimes, working on a new branch, maybe updated files will create some conflicts for my branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are similar to clones but work only over remote repositories (GitHub). Clones can be used remoto to local or even local to local. Branches create new implementations of codes (it can be local or remote).
